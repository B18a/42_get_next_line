  Project - get_next_line
</h1>

The project focuses on creating a function, get_next_line(), that reads a line from a file descriptor in C. It aims to enhance your understanding of static variables and proper memory management. The function should return a line with the terminating newline character, handle multiple calls efficiently, and be adaptable to different buffer sizes. Bonus tasks include supporting multiple file descriptors with a single static variable. Successful completion will allow integration into your libft for future projects.
